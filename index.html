    <h1>What I've Learnt So <i>Far</i> About HTML</h1>
   <P>HTML means <b>Hyper Text Mark Up Language</b>. It describes the structure of a <i>Web page.</i><br>
     There are 3 main building blocks in HTML:<br>
     1. Tags. <br>2. Attributes. <br>3. Elements.<br>
     HTML contains several elements for defining text with a special meaning. E.g, <b>This is a bold text</b>, 
     <del>This is a deleted text</del>, <em>This is an emphasized text</em> etc.<br>
    The above sentences are in a paragraph (p) tag. And lastly the the headings (h) tag can be (h1-h6), h1 being the 
    most important heading and h6 being the least important heading.
